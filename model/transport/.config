help     The transport coefficients consist of the viscosity, thermal conductivity, mass diffusion coefficients, and the mobility of each species. Dixon-Lewis bases its transport coefficients on the Lennard-Jones potentials while Gnoffo includes data for specific pairs of species. Capitelli and Gupta-Yos are more accurate at higher temperatures.
