help     The transport coefficients consist of the viscosity, thermal conductivity, mass diffusion coefficients, and the mobility of each species. Dixon-Lewis is applicable to any chemical solver. Gupta-Yos is more accurate at higher temperatures in excess of 5000 K but can only be used for 11-species air chemical solvers.
